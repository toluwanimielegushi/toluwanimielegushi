**Welcome to my GitHub!**

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a background in **Petroleum and Gas Engineering**, passionate about uncovering insights that help people and businesses make better decisions. I work across **Power BI, SQL, and Excel** to clean, explore, and visualize data that tells meaningful stories.

📊 From employee analytics to customer churn and healthcare data, I enjoy solving real-world problems by asking smart questions, validating the data, and sharing what I find through clean dashboards and clear reports.

### 🔍 What I bring to the table:
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Insightful Dashboards & Reports (Excel, Power BI & SQL)

### 💡 I believe data is only as powerful as the story it tells.  
Every dataset has a message — and I love helping people hear it clearly.
